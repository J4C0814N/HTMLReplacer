# HTMLReplacer
Basic HTML tag and attribute tools bundled into a hopefully semi-descent GUI.

This app came about because I needed a better way to fix WCAG 2.0 AA validation errors in HTML code generated by third-party tools.
One of the biggest things was that no <label> tags included a for attribute. 

I plan to continue developing it as more issues similar to the above come up. 

At the moment it is super basic. Only one working function, and no complex objects. Uses the [HTMLAgilityPack NuGet Package](https://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/).

Basic usage:

1. Download
2. Compile / Run
3. Copy/Paste HTML directly into the left textbox and press the >> button
  1. Alternatively use the Import button to select a html/text file directly
4. Watch the magic happen
